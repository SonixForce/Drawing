# Drawing

This will be a simple web page that permits to make drawings with the mouse and the arrow keys.

The purpose of this web page is that it will test the abilities of programming that i've gained thanks to a course that i just completed.

I've planned that the page will have features like changing colors and the thickness of the line; all will be organized and presentable with a .css.

As a note, everything is planned in my mind as i need to look for a good way to create algorithms and pseudo-code.
